# rtmpdump-lifesize
Use rtmpdump to download videos from vc.agrsci.dk (a server running LifeSize UVC Video Center).

You need to check out [my fork of rtmpdump](https://github.com/Mortal/rtmpdump) in the directory where you check out this repository and compile it.

Then, you need to install the Python 3 `requests` module and simply run the Python 3 script with the URL of the video you wish to download.
